Familiar with fundamentals of C
Standard library of C++

char,int,float,double
C89 defined by ANSI
C99 defines bool

void : type specifier which indicates no type

Derived data types:
Array
Structure
Pointer
Function
String - C-Strings are not really  types
CStrings are basically functiosn in string package

Type modifiers
short
long
signed
unsigned

C variables can contain digits, letters or underscore
It can start with an underscore or a letter

Literals
refer to fixed values of a built-in type
literals are constant values having co nstant types

Structures

Two ways of declaring structures

struct Complex {

}

Usage: struct Complex x = {};

typedef struct _Books{

}

Books book;
book.member;

Unions
Is a special structure that allocates memory  only for the largest data member and holds only one member at a time.

Pointer : is a variable whose value is a memory address
The type of a pointer is determined by the type of its pointee.

int *ip; //pointer is an integer
double *dp; //pointer is a double
float *fp; // pointer is a float
char *ch; //pointer is a character

using a pointer

int i = 20;
int *ip;
ip = &i;

C++ convention
Any C type header can be used in C++ as well but when you use it, it should be
prefixed with c. For example the math.h header in C++ is called cmath(as observed)
in the Square_root.cpp example
